## Problem space

Based on the research documented in [discovery.md](https://github.com/refinedstructure/swift-projects/blob/main/cli-apps/HabitTracker/research/discovery.md), three core problem patterns consistently emerge across habit-tracking products.

First, most habit-tracking apps over-index on **daily consistency and streak preservation**. Progress is framed in an all-or-nothing manner, where missing a single day resets or devalues prior effort. This rigidity creates unnecessary pressure and often leads to anxiety, guilt, and disengagement. Instead of supporting habit formation, streak-centric systems can punish, which is counterproductive to long-term behavior change.

Second, **non-daily habits are poorly supported**. Many real-world habits operate on weekly, monthly, or flexible schedules, yet most apps provide limited customization beyond daily checklists. As a result, users with non-daily goals are forced into ill-fitting structures, leading to inaccurate tracking, frustration, or abandonment of the tool altogether.

Third, **tracking itself often feels like additional work** rather than a natural extension of the habit. For example, a user who completes a workout late in the day may forget or lack the energy to log it afterward. In such cases, manual logging becomes an extra cognitive step imposed after the achievement, reducing the perceived value of tracking and increasing friction over time.

Together, these issues suggest that current habit-tracking systems optimize for **consistency metrics rather than sustainable behavior**, increasing cognitive and emotional load instead of reducing it.
