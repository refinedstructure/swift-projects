**[Market Discovery & Problem Space Analysis](cli-apps/HabitTracker/research/discovery.md)**

Before building, I went through 50+ Reddit threads, app reviews, and blog posts to find patterns in why people quit habit tracking apps.

Top hypotheses:
- Streak mechanics cause anxiety and guilt (designed for progress, not streaks)
- Tracking feels like extra work (CLI-first for speed)
- Notifications cause fatigue (pull-based, not push-based)

This is secondary research - hypotheses to validate. Direct user interviews are the next step.

This framing shows you did pre-build research, connects it to design decisions, and is honest that it still needs validation.
