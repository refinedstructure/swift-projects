# Habit Tracker – User Research (Raw Discovery)

Source: Perplexity deep research  
Query link: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/fc68e56c-b44a-49f2-a9e2-cd7b7a854e4f#0  
Method: Cross-analysis of Reddit discussions, app reviews, essays, and mental health articles.  
Scope: Habit tracking apps .


## AI prompt used (Perplexity)
Task: Product research.  
Instructions: Create two agents. Both, industry-leading product managers. Comb through social media discussions, product reviews, and more to find out the most common frustrations with habit tracking apps.  

One agent gathers insights and digs deeper into the actual JTBD behind that insight. The other agent looks for similar JTBDs experienced by other users and helps the first agent filter out more common JTBDs.  

In the end, create a table of top 10 most pressing issues, their unique JTBDs, and sources. Issues will be in the first column. The analyzed JTBD problem in the second. Each frustration in the end will have multiple sources listed in the third column. The 4th column will have links to all sources. Do not invent or assume frustrations. If there are none found, mention as such. Fewer are better than none.

## Top user frustrations and underlying JTBDs

| User frustration (paraphrased) | Underlying JTBD (analyzed) | Evidence summary | Sources |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|---------|
| Streaks create anxiety, guilt, and all-or-nothing pressure | Help me build habits in an emotionally safe way where missing a day doesn’t erase progress or trigger shame | Users report “streak anxiety,” guilt, and quitting after one missed day | [1][5][6][7][9] |
| Tracking feels like extra admin work | Reduce cognitive load instead of creating a second “meta-habit” of logging and planning | Users say tracking itself becomes burdensome and unsustainable | [1][3][10][11] |
| Interfaces are cluttered and overwhelming | Let me log and review habits in seconds via a minimal interface | Reviews cite overly complex dashboards and feature overload | [10][11][12][13] |
| No way to log partial wins | Let effort count even when I can’t complete the full task | Users frustrated when smaller efforts don’t “count” | [2] |
| Notifications are annoying or badly timed | Nudge me contextually without guilt or notification fatigue | Complaints about generic, frequent, or broken reminders | [14][15] |
| Trackers don’t adapt to mental health, energy, or identity | Help me track habits in a way that respects my real-life constraints | Perfectionism and depression worsen with rigid trackers | [7][16][17][18] |
| Ads, paywalls, and dark patterns break trust | Give me a stable, transparent tool without monetization pressure | Users abandon apps due to aggressive subscriptions and ads | [12][13][14] |
| Poor customization for non-daily habits | Let me flexibly define frequency, intensity, and habit types | Users switch apps due to lack of customization | [2][7][12] |
| Lack of reflection or guidance | Help me interpret my behavior and adjust habits over time | Most apps only show streaks, not insight or learning | [5][8] |
| Social / gamified features feel stressful | Provide optional, psychologically safe accountability | Users dislike performative or competitive habit tracking | [8][20] |
